# Time Saver

The Binding Of Isaac has a couple very tedious things you can do in your game to improve your run's chances. This mod seeks to automate those things, so you can take advantage without subjecting yourself to the tedium of doing it manually.

Time Saver currently contains the following features:

* Automatically destroys all poop and fire in a room once completed.
* Automatically destroys all rocks, pots, etc. in a room if the player has gained an 'infinite bombs/destroyer' item (ipecac, dr. fetus, terra, etc)

Only tested as working in Repentance. YMMV with any other version of the game.

# TODO

* Clean up terrible code
* Mod config menu compatibility to change hotkey
* Check tear flags instead of specific items manually, for compatibility and cleaner code
